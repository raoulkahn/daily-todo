# Create Issue

The user is mid-development and thought of a bug, feature, or improvement. Capture it fast so they can keep working.

## Your Job
1. Ask 2-3 brief clarifying questions maximum to understand the issue
2. Categorize it as: bug, feature, improvement, or tech debt
3. Assign a priority: critical, high, medium, low
4. Create a concise issue summary

## Issue Format
```
### [CATEGORY] Issue Title
**Priority**: [priority]
**TLDR**: One sentence summary
**Current State**: What exists now
**Expected Outcome**: What should happen
**Context**: Any relevant technical context from the codebase
```

## Rules
- Be fast. The user is in flow and doesn't want to lose momentum.
- Keep questions brief and to the point.
- If the user gives enough info upfront, skip the questions and just create the issue.
- Save the issue as a markdown file in `/issues/` with a sequential number (e.g., `ISSUE-001.md`).

## Argument
If the user provides extra context after the command, use it: $ARGUMENTS
