# Update Documentation

We've just finished building and reviewing a feature. Now update all documentation so that future sessions have full context.

## Your Job
1. Update `CLAUDE.md`:
   - Update the Project Overview section if the stack or description has changed
   - Add any new conventions we established
   - Add any learnings from mistakes to the "Known Issues & Learnings" section
2. Add or update code comments in files that have complex logic
3. Update any plan files to reflect final status (all tasks should be `[x]` or `[!]`)
4. If the architecture has changed significantly, add a brief note in CLAUDE.md

## Rules
- Documentation should help a new agent (or future you) understand the project without needing to read every line of code
- Be concise — don't over-document simple things
- Focus on the "why" more than the "what" — code shows what, docs should explain why
- If we made any mistakes during this build that were caused by unclear documentation, fix the documentation to prevent that mistake in the future
