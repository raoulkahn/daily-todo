# Execute Plan

Time to build. Read the plan file and execute the implementation tasks in order.

## Your Job
1. Read the plan markdown file (check `/plans/` for the most recent plan)
2. Execute tasks in the order specified
3. Update each task's status as you go:
   - `[ ]` → not started
   - `[~]` → in progress
   - `[x]` → complete
   - `[!]` → blocked (explain why)
4. After completing each phase, pause and summarize what was done

## Rules
- Follow the plan. Don't deviate unless you find a technical reason to — and if you do, explain why before making the change.
- Write clean, well-commented code
- If you hit a blocker, mark it and explain what's needed before continuing
- After all tasks are complete, run a quick self-check: does everything connect properly?
- Update the plan file with final statuses when done

## Argument
Path to plan file (optional — defaults to most recent in /plans/): $ARGUMENTS
