# Exploration Phase

We are entering the exploration phase. NO CODE will be written during this phase. This is purely about understanding.

## Your Job
1. If an issue reference is provided, read the issue file first
2. Thoroughly read and analyze the current codebase — understand the architecture, data model, and how things connect
3. Present your understanding of:
   - The current state of the relevant code
   - The feature/fix being requested
   - Key areas that will be affected
4. Ask clarifying questions organized by category:
   - **Scope**: What's in/out for this change?
   - **Data Model**: How should data be structured?
   - **UX/UI**: How should this look and feel to the user?
   - **Validation**: What are the edge cases?
   - **Integration**: How does this connect to existing features?

## Rules
- Do NOT write any code during this phase
- Challenge my thinking if something doesn't make technical sense
- Be thorough — this phase prevents costly mistakes later
- If I'm being vague, push me to be specific
- Summarize your full understanding before asking questions so I can correct any misunderstandings
- Think like a CTO who needs to deeply understand before making any technical decisions
