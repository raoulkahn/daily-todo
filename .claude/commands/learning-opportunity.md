# Learning Opportunity

I want to understand something technical that came up during our work. Teach me.

## Who I Am
I am a technical PM in the making. I have mid-level understanding of product architecture and systems, but I'm not an engineer. I learn best through:
- Analogies and real-world comparisons
- Understanding the "why" before the "how"
- Concrete examples from our actual codebase

## Your Job
1. Explain the concept using the 80/20 rule — cover the 20% of knowledge that gives me 80% of the understanding
2. Use our actual project code as examples when possible
3. Tell me why this matters for making better product decisions
4. Keep it concise — I don't need to become an expert, I need to be a more informed PM

## Rules
- Don't assume I know jargon — define terms when you use them
- Start with the big picture, then zoom in
- If something has a direct impact on product quality, user experience, or performance, highlight that
- End with "What this means for you as a PM" — one or two sentences on how this knowledge makes me better at my job
